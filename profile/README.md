## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Minnesota Computer Club

### What do we do?

Anything you can think of! There are lots of ways to get involved, and you can choose how much you want to contribute.

### Connect with New People

Our community has teachers, fellow students, and industry professionals. It is a great place to meet people with similar interests and learn about topics in Computer Science that are entirely new to you!

### Learn New Skills

Our Discord server has dedicated channels for you to learn alongside people that are interested in similar topics in Computer Science by sharing good tutorials, articles, or some of your side projects.

### Show Off Your Skills

Compete in competitions like our Spring Coding Challenge (SCC) to show off mad skills (and win prizes!) all while learning tips and tricks from other members.

### Contribute to Community Projects

Projects (like this website!) are entirely created and maintained by members of our community. Have an interest in helping out? We would love to have you!
